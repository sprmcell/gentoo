# gentoo
A couple off files from my gentoo install to make my next gentoo installation just a tad bit easier 

# Installation

Since git isnt preinstalled, u will need to use links to go to this github, and locate the make.conf you need and save the file

# Future of this project

for now i only have EFI-64, maybe eventually when i have the time i will install it on legacy and maybe a 32 bit system, i have a 64 bit legacy laptop lying around so i could maybe install gentoo on it and see what flags are mainly different

# How can i contact you?
