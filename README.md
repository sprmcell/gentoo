# gentoo
A couple off files from my gentoo install to make my next gentoo installation just a tad bit easier 

# Installation

Since git isnt preinstalled, u will need to use links to go to this github, and locate the make.conf you need and save the file

# Future of this project

I try to edit every now and then, i really want to add 32bit but havent gotten around doing it yet

# How can i contact you?
