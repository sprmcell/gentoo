# gentoo
A couple off files from my gentoo install to make my next gentoo installation just a tad bit easier 

# Installation

Yes i am aware that git is not preinstalled with gentoo.
Wait until you chroot and can actually emerge packages, or links to this page

# Future of this project

for now i only have EFI-64, maybe eventually when i have the time i will install it on legacy and maybe a 32 bit system, i have a 64 bit legacy laptop lying around so i could maybe install gentoo on it and see what flags are mainly different
